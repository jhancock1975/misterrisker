when a major change is implemented offer to commit and push everything

always use test-driven development (TDD)

tests that take longer tha one second to complete are considered long-running

don't put long-running tests in test/

put end-to-end tests in e2e_tests/

if there is some other form of long-running test

if there is a long-runing test that is not an end-to-end test, ask what folder to create to put it in
