create the Coinbase API agent
#+begin_quote
ok, let's put the slack app/agent on hold, and i need to develop a new agents, for Coinbase.  Use the documentation in resources/coinbase-api.md for the Coinbase agent and supplement the information from the internet as needed. Use test driven development.  Write the tests first, then the code to pass the tests. Make the APIs documented in resources/ be mcp services that expose tools for all api functions. Make the Coinbase API tools all available to the Coinbase agent. Create entries in .env for everything the agents need to connect to the APIs (api keys, client ids, secrets, etc.) Keep the code separate for the MCP server and the Agent. Make sure to write tests to cover at least 90% of the code.
